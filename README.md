# Hello! 👋 I am Francesco

**Welcome to my GitHub profile!**

I am a developer and 12th grade student passionate about technology, innovation and problem solving. With a solid background in Python, I don't limit myself to one technology and have explored various areas. I enjoy working on projects ranging from web applications, mobile apps, open source projects, AI and cybersecurity.

## 🔧 Technical skills

- **Programming Languages:** Python, C, Java, Dart, JavaScript, Rust
- **Frameworks and Libraries:** React, Next.js, Flutter, Flask, FastAPI
- **Tools and Platforms:** Docker, Git

## 🚀 Projects

I am always looking for new challenges and opportunities to learn and grow. Some of my recent projects include:

- **ProjectVirgil:** Large project developed in Python and other secondary technologies with the goal of creating a virtual assistant with integrated GPT (currently archived).
- **ProjectIppocrate:** School project created with the aim of developing a CMS for page management.
- **Olicyber:** Project on cybersecurity (CTF) culminating in a competition on 8 June 2024.
- **Soon:** ...

## 🌱 What I am studying

I am currently delving into CTF and cybersecurity skills. I am excited to explore new technologies and apply them in real projects. As I am still very young, I am taking advantage of my time to explore various fields of IT, so that I can target and specialise in a specific branch in the future.
